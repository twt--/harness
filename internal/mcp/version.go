// Package mcp implements a tools-only Model Context Protocol slice: the wire
// schema types, version negotiation, a Client (initialize handshake, tools/list
// pagination, tools/call with cancellation), a Server that serves one session
// over one connection, a stdio pipe adapter, and the cross-binary default socket
// path. It builds on internal/mcp/jsonrpc for framing and bidirectional
// correlation and depends only on the standard library. It deliberately does
// not import internal/llm or internal/tools so both cmd/harness (client) and the
// future cmd/harness-mcp-gateway (server + downstream client) can share it.
